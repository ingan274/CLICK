    <p class="problem">Finding love is hard, even for celebrities. Celebrities are experts in thier field, but are only
        a fraction of the experts in the world. We want to connect experts, both celebrities and connoisseurs in thier
        an industry, together.</p>
    <p class="solution">CLICK is building a community that allows you to find your "click" within industries that you
        are knowledgable about. Among a number of dating apps, we lose quality. With our unique entry quiz that is
        shaped to the common interest people are looking for, we use a common interest and baseline knowledge as a
        spring board to finding love. For the priliminary application, we focused on the commonality and love for
        technology. We bring together experts and celebrities wtihin the technological industry for the potential of
        finding love. Future development would allow users to choose a specific industry or hobby, complete a short

            Isabel's interest in Human-Computer Interaction comes from my interest in people. Though her studies into people
            and their experiences with visual concepts, Isabel realized people perceptions changes the way they experiences
            the world. Through her work in Fashion and Advertising, she quickly realized how technology and user's
            experience with technology motivates even the most human experiences: maintaining relationships to
            expressing our every triumphs and tribulations. And what captivates Isabel most about people is the cyclical
            relationship we have with designing these technologies: we shape them, and they shape us.
