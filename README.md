## About Click

##### Finding love is hard, even for celebrities. Celebrities are experts in thier field, but are only a fraction of the true talent in the world. We want to connect experts, both celebrities and connoisseurs in thier an industry, together.

CLICK is building a community that allows you to find your "click" within industries that you are knowledgable about. Among the plethora of dating apps, we lose quality. With our unique entry quiz that is shaped to the common interest people are looking for, we use a common interest and baseline knowledge as a spring board to finding love. For the priliminary application, we focused on the commonality and love for technology. We bring together experts and celebrities wtihin the technological industry for the potential of finding love. Future development would allow users to choose a specific industry or hobby, complete a short quiz, and be free to find their click.
